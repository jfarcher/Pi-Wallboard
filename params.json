{"name":"Pi-wallboard","tagline":"","body":"### Pi-Wallboard\r\nPi wallboard is essentially a digital display solution, configuring a stock Raspbian install to launch Chromium in kiosk mode on boot. Chromium will display a given URL from a stored configuration file, restarting the browser should the configuration file be modified.\r\n\r\nUsing the tvservice tools supplied with Raspbian cron jobs are also added to put the attached display into standby mode, resulting in the display going to sleep should it support this feature.\r\n\r\nThis wallboard solution is ideal for datacentre monitoring and information display. eg. call centres, and IT operations centres.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nInstallation is very straightforward,\r\n\r\n`git clone https://github.com/jfarcher/Pi-Wallboard`\r\n\r\n`cd Pi-Wallboard`\r\n\r\n`chmod +x config.sh`\r\n\r\n`sudo ./config.sh`\r\n\r\nComplete the install by answering any questions presented.\r\n\r\nA puppet module is also included to allow central configuration, ideal if multiple screens are to be deployed. Simply copy the puppet directory to your puppetmasters modules directory\r\n\r\n`cp -r puppet /etc/puppet/modules/wallboards`\r\n\r\nthe files directory contains a sample configuration, these should be stored in the format wallboard.conf-hostname. Replacing hostname with the actual short hostname of your raspberry pi.\r\n\r\nShould you not employ a puppet environment this will be recognised during the install and relevant puppet based configuration be applied.\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
